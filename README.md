# CMPE295-Autonomous-Detection
City streets face safety risks from road hazards, illegal encampments, and vandalism. Many cities lack real-time hazard detection, relying on slow inspections. This project uses AI and autonomous vehicle cameras to detect and report issues instantly. By analyzing road data, it helps cities prioritize repairs, improving safety and response times.
